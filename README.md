# Rustlings 🦀❤️

</div>

Greetings and welcome to Rustlings.
This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code.
This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!

It is recommended to do the Rustlings exercises in parallel to reading [the official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), the most comprehensive resource for learning Rust 📚️

[Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) is another recommended resource that you might find helpful.
It contains code examples and exercises similar to Rustlings, but online.
